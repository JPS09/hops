# Hops!... I did it again!

This was the final project of **[the Wagon Bootcamp Course](https://www.lewagon.com/fr "Check it out")** which was made in **9 days**  by **a team of four people**

## The Issue

We wanted to **solve an issue** that a _large part of the beers lovers_ know all too well, which is to **keep track** of **which beers they tasted** and their _associated quality_.

The _previous solution_ was to **write it down in a notebook**, but it can **quickly become tedious** to carry the notebook around while _risking to lose it_ which can be a **disaster**.

## Our Solution

We though of a device which would allow us to **improve** on the _previous solution_ and has become a _part of our lives_, ***our phones***.
