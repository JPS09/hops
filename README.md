# Hops!... I did it again!

This was the final project of **[the Wagon Bootcamp Course](https://www.lewagon.com/fr "Check it out")** which was made in **9 days**  by **a team of four people**.

## The Issue

The _number of beers_ are **steadily increasing** due to the ***growing popularity*** of this _type of beverage_. It has become _increasingly **difficult**_ to **keep track** of _which beer_ has been tried and **if it was good**.

## Existing solution

### Notebooks

Writing this information in a notebook can seem a good idea but it comes with disavantages :

- You **always need to carry it** on yourself _wherever_ you go _in case_ someone offers you to grab a drink.
- You **need to be consistant** in the way you _document your discoveries_.
- ***If you lose it***, you ***loose all your precious informations*** _without hope of getting it back_.

## Our Solution

### A Ruby on Rails project

A web application seemed a logical choice to solve these issues :

- It **can be accessed** from _anywhere_ and on _any device_.
- The data you enters is _already formated_ in a **pleasing way** for you.
- _If you lose your phone_, the data is **still persisted** and is ***still available*** to you.

## The Features

This section is divided between the differents sections of our project for lisibility but they are related in the actuel website.

### Beers features

This is the core of our website, around which everything else gravitate.


Brewery Features

Search feature (+scan)

Cellar Features

- Users can add beers if they are not yet present
- Users see the beers

## Have a look

**Our project** is available **[here][Hops]** for you to _see all these features_ in action.

### Side note

You *may experience* ***some latency*** while _first accessing_ our website, this is **due to our hosting service** and is beyond our control.

Please _be patient_ and feel free to **grab a beer** while it loads.
