# Hops!... I did it again!

This was the final project of **[the Wagon Bootcamp Course](https://www.lewagon.com/fr "Check it out")** which was made in **9 days**  by **a team of four people**

## The Issue

The _number of beers_ are **steadily increasing** due to the ***growing popularity*** of this _type of beverage_. It has become _increasingly **difficult**_ to **keep track** of _which beer_ has been tried and **if it was good**.

## Existing solution

### Writing this information in a notebook can seem a good idea but it comes with disavantages:

- You **always need to carry it** on yourself _wherever_ you go _in case_ someone offers you to grab a drink
- You **need to be consistant** in the way you _document your discoveries_
- ***If you lose it***, you ***loose all your precious informations*** _without hope of getting it back_.

## Our Solution

### A web application seemed a logical choice to solve these issues:

- It **can be accessed** from _anywhere_ and on _any device_.
- The data you enters is _already formated_ in a **pleasing way** for you
- _If you lose your phone_, the data is **still persisted** and is ***still available*** to you

## The Features

~~WIP~~

You *may experience* ***some latency*** while _first accessing_ our website, this is **due to our hosting service** and is beyond our control.
